## Hi there, I'm Nayef 

I'm interested in solving decision problems at scale. To me that involves learning a lot about: 
- abstracting away from specifics to general cases that can be solved using formal methods (mathematical modeling and algorithms)
- understanding uncertain relationships between multiple variables (statistics and causal inference)
- finding the best option from among very large sets of options (optimization)
- getting computers to do the work (machine learning, programming)
- making sure the work has a positive impact (designing workflows, training/communicating, algorithmic bias)
